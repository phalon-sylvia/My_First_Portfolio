# My First Portfolio — HTML Basics

## Learning Objectives

- Understand what HTML is and how it works
- Create valid HTML pages using proper markup
- Use tags and attributes correctly to structure content
- Understand what a markup language and the DOM are

## Requirements

- Use only HTML/CSS/JavaScript (no external libraries or frameworks)
- Files should end with a newline
- Include a `README.md` at the project root
- Validate pages with the W3C HTML Validator

## Files

- `base_index.html` — Minimal valid HTML file for this project

## How to view and validate

1. Open `base_index.html` in your browser.
2. To validate, use the W3C Validator: https://validator.w3.org/ and paste the file contents or provide the file URL.

## Notes

- This project is intentionally minimal to teach core HTML concepts.
